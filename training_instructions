= to train, call the train_generator.py script:

python train_generator.py

- Make sure this is the python version that has tensorflow installed.

- At first, some errors may occur. Depending on the system, some modifications may have to be made
    Pay attention to any error messages and correct the issue.

- To play with some parameters, you may edit the train_generator.py file on the
    fit_generator keyword arguments. The model will be trained in epochs, and each time an epoch completes,
    a checkpoint file will be created in the checkpoint/ directory. Make sure this directory exists before
    committing hours to training only to have it fail!
